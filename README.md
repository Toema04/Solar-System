# Planet Textures

This directory should contain texture images for all planets:

- Mercury.jpg
- Venus.jpg
- Earth.jpg
- Mars.jpg
- Jupiter.jpg
- Saturn.jpg
- Uranus.jpg
- Neptune.jpg

These texture images need to be downloaded and placed in this directory.

## Recommended Sources

You can obtain free planetary textures from:

1. NASA's Solar System Exploration website
2. Solar System Scope (solarsystemscope.com)
3. Planetary Pixel Emporium (planetpixelemporium.com)

Make sure to download and place these files here before running the application.

## Placeholder Image Generation

If you need a quick start, you can generate basic placeholder textures using the following steps:

1. Create a simple HTML file that uses Canvas API to generate placeholder textures
2. Save the Canvas outputs as JPG files
3. Place these files in this directory
